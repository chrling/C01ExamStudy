- John would like to be able to reserve a car he likes in advances such that he
  can pick it up and drive away as soon as he arrives at a new city
- John would like to sign up to the unlimited kilometers plan since he travels
  often so that he can save on rental cost
- John would like to be sent the total cost of the rental when the car is
  returned so that he can send the bill to his employer BestBuy and have them
  reimburse the cost
- John would like to be able to cancel his reservation so that when his plans 
  change he does not have to pay for the rental of a car he will not use
